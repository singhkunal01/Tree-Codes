<h1 align="center" > WHAT IS BINARY SEARCH TREE ? 	:roll_eyes: 	:thinking: </h1>

Ans: **Binary Search Tree** is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:

- The **left subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys _**' lesser '**_ than the node’s key.
- The **right subtree** of a node contains only nodes with keys _**' greater '**_ than the node’s key.
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
